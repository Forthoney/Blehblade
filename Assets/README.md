# Assets Manual
## Organization
Assets are organized into several folders, generated by default by Unity.
We do not use all these folders.
As of moving onto concretely importing art/music assets we only use
- Audio
- Prefabs
- Scenes
- Sprites

The names are pretty self explanatory: audio assets go in Audio, art assets go in Sprites.
**Do not put art assets in Materials**.
Although eventually image files are transformed into materials, we do so within Sprites.

## Importing Art
Due to the 2.5D nature of the project, putting sprites on objects are a bit more tricky.
When importing art, make sure of the following
- PNG format
- Integer aspect ratio (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 2:5)
- Descriptive name
- Properly foldered (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3)

When putting an image on an object, you can drag the PNG onto the object.
After putting it on, you may notice that the PNG transparency is not well reflected. 
To fix this, go to the `Materials` folder in the same directory. 
For example, if your PNG is in the `Assets/Sprites/Level1` Folder, go to `Assets/Sprites/Level1/Materials`
There, click on the material with the same name as the imported PNG. 
On the material's inspector panel, select "Cutout" for Rendering Mode (it should be Opaque by default).
